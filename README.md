# React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

I wanted to revisit this tutorial to see how it has been updated since I first worked through it as part of Academy Pittsburgh bootcamp curriculum with class components.

[Helpful article](https://seanaujong.medium.com/implementing-the-react-tic-tac-toe-challenges-ed57d7ae4f67) for the extra steps.

## TODO Extra Challenges
- [X] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
- [X] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [X] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [X] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
